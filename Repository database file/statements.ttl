  rdfs:comment "The Russian Twist is a type of exercise that is used to work the abdomen muscles by performing a twisting motion on the abdomen. The exercise is believed by those who practice it to build explosiveness in the upper torso, which may help in sports such as swimming, baseball, track & field, hockey, golf, lacrosse, or boxing."@en;

dbr:Sit-up :exercise_instruction "Raise torso from bench by bending waist and hips. Return until back of shoulders contact incline board. Repeat.";
  rdfs:comment "The sit-up is an abdominal endurance training exercise commonly performed to strengthen and tone the abdominal muscles. It is similar to a crunch (crunches target the rectus abdominus and also work the external and internal obliques), but sit-ups have a fuller range of motion and condition additional muscles. Sit-ups target the hip flexors, rectus abdominus and also work the iliopsoas, tensor fasciae latae, rectus femoris, sartorius, and, to a very small degree, the obliques."@en;
  rdfs:label "Sit-up"@en .

dbr:Wall_sit :exercise_instruction "Make sure your back is flat against the wall. Set your feet about shoulder-width apart and then about 2 ft out from the wall. Slide your back down the wall bending your legs until they’re in a 90 degree angle—or as close as you can get! Your knees should be directly above your ankles but no more forward. HOLD your position while contracting your abs. Stand slowly while leaning against the wall when done.";
  rdfs:comment "A wall sit, also known as a Roman Chair, is an exercise done to strengthen the quadriceps muscles. It is characterized by the two right angles formed by the body, one at the hips and one at the knees. The person wall sitting places their back against a wall with their feet shoulder width apart and a little ways out from the wall. Then, keeping their back against the wall, they lower their hips until their knees form right angles. This is a very intense work out for the quadriceps muscles. It can be very painful to hold this position for extended periods of time. Wall sits are used as a primary strengthening exercise in many sports requiring strong quadriceps like fencing, ice hockey, sailing (mostly small boat racing), skiing and track and field.This exercise is also used as a disciplinary"@en;

  :hasForce :pull;
  rdfs:comment "The leg raise is a strength training exercise which targets the iliopsoas (the interior hip flexors). Because the abdominal muscles are used isometrically to stabilize the body during the motion, leg raises are also often used to strengthen the rectus abdominis muscle and the internal and external oblique muscles."@en;

dbr:L-sit :exercise_instruction "Simultaneously raise knees and torso until hips and knees are flexed. Return to starting position with waist hips and knees extended. Repeat.";

  rdfs:comment "The L-sit is an acrobatic body position in which all body weight rests on the hands, with the torso held in a slightly forward-leaning orientation, with legs held horizontally so that each leg forms a nominal right-angle with the torso. The right-angle causes the body to have a notable \"L\" shape, hence the name \"L-sit\". It requires significant abdominal strength. When executing an L-sit, a variety of supports may be used by the performer, including gymnastics apparatus such as the floor, rings, parallel bars or parallettes, or the hands of an adagio partner."@en;

  :hasForce :push;
  rdfs:comment "The leg extension is a resistance weight training exercise that targets the quadriceps muscle in the legs. The exercise is done using a machine called the Leg Extension Machine. There are various manufacturers of these machines and each one is slightly different. Most gym and weight rooms will have the machine in their facility. The leg extension is an isolated exercise targeting one specific muscle group, the quadriceps. It should not be considered as a total leg workout, such as the squat or deadlift."@en;

  :hasForce :push;
  rdfs:comment "The military press is a variation of the overhead press weight training exercise using very strict form and no pre-movement momentum. The military press targets the deltoid muscles in the shoulders as well as the triceps. Additionally, it works the core and legs, which the lifter uses to help stabilize the weight. The lift begins with the lifter standing with both feet together and the barbell on the anterior deltoids. The lifter then raises the barbell overhead by pressing the palms of the hands against the underside of the barbell."@en;

  :hasForce :push;
  rdfs:comment "Lying triceps extensions, also known as skull crushers and French extensions or French presses, are a strength exercise used in many different forms of strength training. Lying triceps extensions are one of the most stimulating exercises to the entire triceps muscle group in the upper arm. It works the triceps from the elbow all the way to the latissimus dorsi. Due to its full use of the Triceps muscle group, the lying triceps extensions are used by many as part of their training regimen."@en;

dbr:Good-morning :exercise_instruction "Keeping back straight bend hips to lower torso forward until parallel to floor. Raise torso until hips are extended. Repeat.";
  :hasForce :push;
  rdfs:comment "The good-morning is a weight-lifting exercise. It is known as a good morning because of the movement in the erector spinae which resembles the rise out of bed to stretch. The erector spinae muscles of the lower back work isometrically to keep the spine in an extended position while the hamstrings and gluteus maximus work isotonically to perform hip extension. Other muscles are involved in stabilizing weight on the back and maintaining balance."@en;

dbr:Bench_press :exercise_instruction "Lower weight to chest. Press bar upward until arms are extended. Repeat.";
  :hasForce :push;
  rdfs:comment "The bench press is an upper body strength training exercise that consists of pressing a weight upwards from a supine position. The exercise works the pectoralis major as well as supporting chest, arm, and shoulder muscles such as the anterior deltoids, serratus anterior, coracobrachialis, scapulae fixers, trapezii, and the triceps. A barbell is generally used to hold the weight, but a pair of dumbbells can also be used."@en;

The term leg press also refers to the apparatus used to perform this exercise. The leg press can be used to evaluate an athlete's overall lower body strength (from knee joint to hip). It has the potential to inflict grave injury: the knees could bend the wrong way if they are locked during a leg press. There are two main types of leg press:"@en;

  :hasForce :pull;
  :hasMechanics :compound;
  rdfs:comment "The upright row is a weight training exercise performed by holding a grips with the overhand grip and lifting it straight up to the collarbone. This is a compound exercise that involves the trapezius, the deltoids and the biceps. The narrower the grip the more the trapezius muscles are exercised, as opposed to the deltoids. Barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells or a cable machine can be used.

  rdfs:comment "The rear delt raise, also known as the rear deltoid raise, or rear shoulder raise is an exercise in weight training. This exercise is an isolation exercise that heavily works the posterior deltoid muscle. The movement is primarily limited to the two shoulder joints: the glenohumeral joint and the scapulothoracic joint. Scapular movement will also cause movement in the sternoclavicular joint and acromioclavicular joint. If the elbow bends during the extension exercises, it gravitates into a rowing motion."@en;
